This guide covers the branching model, CI, and deployment. For how to submit changes, see

## Branching Model

All work happens on feature branches created off `develop`. When ready, the branch is squash merged
into `develop` via a pull request. The PR title becomes the commit message on `develop`.

Every merge to `develop` triggers a build and deploy to GitHub Pages. There is no staging
environment or soak period. The build either succeeds or it doesn't.

Nothing is committed directly to `develop`. All changes go through pull requests so CI runs before
merging.

## CI

Every pull request targeting `develop` runs five checks in parallel:

| Job        | Command             | What it catches                   |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Format     | `pnpm format:check` | Unformatted code                  |
| Lint       | `pnpm lint`         | ESLint errors                     |
| Type Check | `pnpm check`        | TypeScript and Svelte type errors |
| Test       | `pnpm test`         | Failing unit tests (Vitest)       |
| Build      | `pnpm build`        | Build failures, broken routes     |

All five must pass before a PR can be merged. Tests live in `tests/` at the repository root. PR
titles are validated against conventional commit format.

## Deployment

The site is built with `pnpm build`, which runs adapter-static and outputs plain HTML, CSS, and JS
to `build/`. This output is deployed to GitHub Pages.

There is no runtime, no server process, and no environment variables at serve time. Deployment is
copying files.
